# Rosé Pine for GRUB 2

> Maintained by our lovely community ☺️

All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist.

## Usage

If you're gonna do it from the CLI, have fun. I'm sure you wouldn't need instructions at that point.

For the rest of us: 

1. Download the `rose-pine-grub.tar.gz` from the releases tab
2. Launch [grub-customizer](https://pkgs.org/download/grub-customizer)
3. Navigate to appearance settings
4. Go to theme and hit the plus button, and select `rose-pine-grub.tar.gz`
5. Select it form the list and hit Save in the top left
6. Reboot
