# Rosé Pine

All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist.

### Instructions

If you're gonna do it from the CLI, have fun. I'm sure you wouldn't need instructions at that point.

For the rest of us: 

1. Download the `rosepine-grub.tar.gz` from the releases tab.
2. Download the program [grub-customizer](https://pkgs.org/download/grub-customizer).
3. Launch grub-customizer.
4. Navigate to appearance settings. 
5. Go to theme and hit the plus button, and select `rosepine-grub.tar.gz`.
6. Select it form the list and hit Save in the top left.
7. Reboot.
